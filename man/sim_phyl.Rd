\arguments{
  \item{ct}{Crown time}
  \item{lambda0,mu0}{Speciation and extinction rates parameter (they depends on the model)}
  \item{K}{Carring capacity (For diversity-dependance model only)}
  \item{Draw}{If Draw=TRUE the simulated phylogenetic tree will be ploted}
  \item{Model}{Diversification model. The available models are 'dd' for diversity dependance and 'cr' for constant rate model}
  \item{PrintEv}{Prints the events while occurring in the tree}
  \item{seed}{Seed for the simulation.}
